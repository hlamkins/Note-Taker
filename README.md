## Overview
This is an application you can use to create, post, and delete notes and save them to your computer. When you add a new note and click save, it will save to the page. You can also delete notes by clicking the trash. 

## Requirements
Need to install node modules with npm i. To run the application, type node server.js in to the terminal and open on your local host 3000.
